  <h1>Well, hello there!</h1>
  <h3>My name is Adibah. Dibs for short.</h3>
  
<p>To be honest, I really missed the good ol' days when vanilla HTML and CSS were the epitome of internet. I remembered those days where I found myself stuck in  an endless rabbit hole; scrolling free HTML / CSS tutorial websites for HOURS and HOURS only to find the perfect profile background, GIFs, animations and audios that would define me (13-years old me in the midst of 2007 was digging Avril Lavigne real bad. My Happy Ending was rad, man. Don't even get me started!).</p>
  
<p>I find it as an exciting way to showcase my expertise and passion in coding (well, I write code for a living so why not play around with this method to do my portfolio instead?).</p>
